Just a little project to play with the idea of a Vigenere Cipher - a method of encrypting text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

However, rather than just encoding/decoding the 26 letters of the English alphabet, I've included both upper and lower case characters (so that encryption/decryption doesn't lose the case of the original text) plus an additional 44 non-alphabetic characters for a total of 96 encodable characters.

vigenere

    ---------- BEGIN ENCRYPTED TEXT ----------
    (*^|"ASF^)S&);^|^_;4Z/<,W';;)F  * |8'8L6.$:8'
    ---------- END ENCRYPTED TEXT ----------
