Just a little project to play with the idea of a Vigenere Cipher - a method of encrypting text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

However, rather than just encoding/decoding the 26 letters of the English alphabet, I've included 69 different characters in my Vigenere key.
